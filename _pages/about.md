About Me
------
I am a first-year Ph.D. student from [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mark Gerstein](https://www.gersteinlab.org/) and [Prof. Smita krishnaswamy](https://krishnaswamylab.org/). My research interests include dynamic systems, manifold learning, machine learning, and its application in computational biology.
